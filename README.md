# FailingIsLearning
I already said it

Failure is a learning opportunity.

Seriously, Failure is the greatest learning opportunity we can possibly exploit.

Nobody should fail on purpose; that's stupid and doesn't make sense

But when we fail, we have an opportunity to learn

Learn like crazy

When we bury failure in lies and jedi mind tricks, we'll repeat them, because we didn't take the opportunity to learn from them
