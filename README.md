Failure is the greatest learning opportunity we can possibly exploit.

Nobody should fail on purpose; that's stupid and doesn't make sense.

But when we fail, we have an opportunity to learn.

Learn like crazy.

When we bury failure in lies and jedi mind tricks, we'll repeat them, because we didn't take the opportunity to learn from them.
