# FailingIsLearning

1. Failure leads to fear
2. Fear leads to anger
3. Anger leads to hate

OR

1. Failure leads to learning
2. Learning leads to options
3. Options lead to success

Failure is the greatest learning opportunity we can possibly exploit. It *can* lead to fear. It shouldn't have to lead to anger, or hate

But when we fail, we have an opportunity to learn.

Learn like crazy.

When we bury failure in lies and jedi mind tricks, we'll repeat them, because we didn't take the opportunity to learn from them.
