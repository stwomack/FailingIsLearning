# FailingIsLearning

Failure leades to fear
Fear leads to suffering
Suffering leads to the dark side

Failure leads to learning
Learning leads to options
Options lead to success

Failure is the greatest learning opportunity we can possibly exploit.

Nobody should fail on purpose; that's stupid and doesn't make sense.

But when we fail, we have an opportunity to learn.

Learn like crazy.

When we bury failure in lies and jedi mind tricks, we'll repeat them, because we didn't take the opportunity to learn from them.
